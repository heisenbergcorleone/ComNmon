# nmon_charts
This project aims at displaying nmon server charts comparatively.
The current branch with all the files and latest commit is develop_2.

To achieve the aim, two comparison method are adopted:
1. Diplaying the charts separately in a single window (status: work in progress!):
    - where the the scrollbars and the mouse events will be synchronised with all other charts.
2. Overlapping the charts. (status: going to be started soon!)


Feel free to suggest an idea/feature. :)
